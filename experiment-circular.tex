\chapter{Circular Experiment}

Workers were asked where the circle was compared to a point in the image. The circle was placed in 32 positions, with the angle between the dot and circle being varied. Each worker was asked to provide 16 responses.

Originally the workers were asked to provide all 32 responses, but no workers decided to  do this. It is unclear if this was due to the number of questions being asked, which was relatively high for each worker, or if it was another issue such as the time of posting the task.
